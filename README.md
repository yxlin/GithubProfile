**`Not a Digital Craftsman (Developer/Creator)`**

I'm a academic, amateur software developer and experimental psychologist. This project is a new journey to build a beautiful the digital world one step at a time. Projects are converted from my academic work and translated to business ideas. To be concise, I limit the length of reference list, which may occassionally omit some. For a wordy version, see, for example, my academic page.
